### How ya goin?
My name is Vikram Ramavarapu. I am currently a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Although I like exploring all kinds of areas and trying out a plethora of different projects, my main interests include BioInformatics/Health Informatics, Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Human Computer Interaction (HCI).  
  
Take a look at some of the pinned projects I have below, and come back to visit as this profile needs updating and I plan to do so! Otherwise
