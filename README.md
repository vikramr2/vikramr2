### Hi!
My name is Vikram Ramavarapu. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. I'm really interested in networks (i.e. really big graphs) and their various applications. Some other interests of mine are: computational biology, high-performance computing, social computing, natural language processing, and UI design.
  
Take a look at some of the pinned projects I have below, and come back to visit as this profile needs updating, and I plan to do so! Otherwise
